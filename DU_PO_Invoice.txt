                                        (Data Extraction From Invoice and Purchase Order)

UseCase: In this usecase requirement is like we recieve Purchase order and Invoice in Input folder. We need to read each file and extract data
from file, fill extracted data in output excel report file. Purchase order in PO Details sheet & Invoice Data in Invoice details sheet. Invoice 
have in image format and PO have in PDF format. At last once Extraction is completed for all file, send excel report file to perticular person on mail.

Robot will follow Automation steps as shown below:

1)RPA robot(Automated Laptop or machine) first will read all PO And Invoice From Input folder.
 
2)[Digitization]--Then robot fetch each file one by one for read all data from document using OCR Technology.

3)[Classification]--After Getting all text from current document robot will understand & Classify doc.either is PO or Invoice using Keyword classifier.

4)[Extraction]--Next step Robot will extract data from doc. using extractor like A]Generative AI for Invoice B]Machine Learning for PO
  BOT will Extract Data using Generative AI(By Prompting), Machine Learning Algorithm and Using OCR
  Applied on document as per their best performance in data extraction for that perticular doc. (can use any extractor for any doc. for better output)

5)[Export Extraction Result]--After data extraction bot will write extracted data in output excel report file.

6)At last bot will send prepared report file on mail to perticular purson.

        Lets Run the Automation.........
 
        [Validation]--If require human can involve in Automation for validate data extraction.

Result: Extracted Details in Output folder Excel file and mail has sent successfully.
